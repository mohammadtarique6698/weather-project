# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Welcome to the Weather Dashboard project! This application provides users with real-time weather information and Air Quality Index (AQI) data for various locations. Users can view weather forecasts, temperature trends, and AQI levels for their selected cities.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Get up-to-date weather information for any city worldwide.
- **Air Quality Index (AQI)**: Monitor the air quality in different locations.
- **Temperature Trends**: View temperature trends over time with interactive charts.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication with Google OAuth.
- **Responsive Design**: Access the dashboard seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Recharts, Material-UI, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth
- **APIs**: Visual Crossing Weather API, Weather by API Ninjas
- **Other Libraries**: Axios, JWT Decode, Notistack, React Icons

## RapidAPI Usage

- This project utilizes two RapidAPI services for weather data and AQI (Air Quality Index) information.
- The weather data is retrieved from the Visual Crossing Weather API, available at [Visual Crossing Weather API](https://rapidapi.com/visual-crossing-corporation-visual-crossing-corporation-default/api/visual-crossing-weather). Please note that there is a limit on API calls, so use them judiciously.
- AQI data is fetched from the Weather by API Ninjas service, accessible at [Weather by API Ninjas](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/weather-by-api-ninjas/). Similar to the weather API, there is a call limit that should be considered.
- Out of the mentioned RapidAPI services, this project primarily focuses on the weather data provided by the Visual Crossing Weather API.

## Usage

1. Run The Project:
   [git clone https://github.com/mohammadtarique6698/weather-project/](https://github.com/mohammadtarique6698/weather-project.git)
   cd weather-dashboard
   npm install
   npm run dev

## Limitations
**The application is subject to the usage limits imposed by the RapidAPI services. Be mindful of the API call limits to avoid disruptions in service.**
